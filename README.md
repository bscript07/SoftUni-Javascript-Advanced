# JS Advanced

In the "JS Advanced" course, students will gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, including syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. More complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, and the event loop will be studied. The course will enhance their algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, participants will be able to work with the DOM tree, manipulate it, and work with events. Both functional and object-oriented programming approaches in JavaScript will be covered, with concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and the prototype chain being studied.
